Dr. Pencilcode (prototype)
==============

Dr. Pencilcode is an analytical tool that evaluates your Pencilcode projects in a variety of computational areas to provide feedback on aspects such as abstraction, logical thinking, synchronization, parallelization, flow control, user interactivity and data representation. This analyzer is a helpful tool to evaluate your own projects, or those of your Pencilcode students.

By now it is just a copy of Dr. Scratch which I am adapting to the Pencilcode environment.
